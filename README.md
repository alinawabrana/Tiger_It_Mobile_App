# Tiger_IT_Mobile_App

The **Tiger_IT_Mobile_App** is a time-constrained UI challenge project built using **Flutter**. The goal was to replicate the **Home Page UI** of the popular _Tiger IT App_ (available on the Play Store) within **3 hours** to assess and sharpen UI building and layout structuring skills in a real-world scenario.

This app focuses on clean UI design using **custom widgets**, **dynamic layouts**, and **Flutter's core rendering capabilities** such as `Stack`, `GridView`, `ListView`, and `CarouselSlider`.

## Project Objective

- Replicate the Home Page layout of Tiger IT App in **3 hours**
- Practice building clean and modular UIs under a tight deadline
- Implement dynamic layout widgets like horizontal + vertical scroll views, carousels, and stacked containers
- Experiment with advanced **Stack** positioning inside containers
